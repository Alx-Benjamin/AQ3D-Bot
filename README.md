**How it Works:**

1. **Setup:**

    * Download and run the bot.
    * Configure the bot by setting the locations of the enemy health bar, player health bar, loot button, revive button detection area, and other relevant elements.
   
   To Set the Enemy Health, Player Health, and Respawn Detection you will be asked to click in two locations. These 2 locations will create a square based on the top left corner, and bottom left corner of those 2 clicks. The Bot then uses these square areas for detection purposes. Please try and mimic the setup shown in the green squares in the examples below.

Assuming you don't change your resolution, you will only have to configure these settings once. 

    * Customize attack keys, movement keys, skill hotkeys, cooldowns, and other settings.
    * Click Save All settings, and you are all set.

2. **Start Grinding:**

    * Start AQ3D and ensure the bot is configured correctly.
    * Click "Start Bot" to begin grinding.

3. **Monitor Progress:**

    * The bot will automatically handle combat, looting, and movement.
    * Monitor the bot's progress and runtime through the log window.

**Disclaimer:**

* This bot is intended for personal use only.
* Always follow the terms of service of AQ3D.
* Use at your own risk.
